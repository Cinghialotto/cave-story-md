# License & Copying

### CS Engine and SGDK - [MIT](LICENSE-MIT)

All the CS engine code, as well as SGDK source uses the MIT license. That's everything in the `src`, `inc`, and `tools` directories, EXCEPT for the files `src/ai/*.c`, which are covered below.

### NXengine-based AI routines - [GPLv3](LICENSE-GPL3)

The source files in `src/ai` are heavily based on NXengine AI code. Though I've made major changes everywhere, both to optimize for speed and to workaround my own engine's quirks, the same underlying structure and logic are used. Therefore, to be safe I am keeping these as GPLv3 which is the license used by NXengine.

### Graphics, Story, and Characters - Property of Studio Pixel

All created by Pixel, unless specified otherwise. I used them without permission. You absolutely can't use these in anything commercial. Nicalis owns the exclusive rights (in the west at least). Not to mention it would be pretty disrespectful to the original creator.

### Music Covers - [CC-BY-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode)

Most of [these](../res/bgm/) are created by me in Deflemask and are CC-BY-NC (give me credit, and don't use it in a commercial product).

A few were remade or modified DavisOlivier. No license was mentioned. Ask them if you want to use these in something:
- Cave Story
- Eyes of Flame
- Gestation
- Gravity
- Fanfare 1 / 2 / 3

### Fonts

The font used in the Title Screen menus, in-game dialogue, and crash messages was made by Sik. Ask him if you want to use them.

The Japanese font is F16. The inside of the file states "(c) Copyright 2000-2003 /efont/ The Electronic Font Open Laboratory."
