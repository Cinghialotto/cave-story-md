### CS Engine and NXengine-based AI routines - [GPLv3](LICENSE-GPL3)

Consider all code except those explicitly mentioned above (and their respective headers) to to GPLv3.
Most of the code in this engine is original, except for the AI routines in `src/ai/`.
Even is places where an AI function is entirely different, NXEngine's version was still used as a starting point.
There are other bits and pieces I took, such as the booster code, proper speeds/logic for weapons, etc.
