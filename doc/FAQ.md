## FAQ

### Why?
To learn MD dev mostly.

### Why not SNES?
While I think the SNES could possibly run CS, I'm not very interested in developing for that console.
Why not give it a shot yourself? With enough patience it could be a fun project.

### When is the next release?
Soon(tm)

### Any physical release?
There is no cartridge release. You could make your own if you want, but don't sell it.
I am not responsible for issues you have with some bootleg cart.

### Can you add new languages and game modes and redo the soundtrack? Also port Jenka's Nightmare next
