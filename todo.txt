ISSUES
- Hell's tileset is cut off so a couple of the rooms are messed up
 - Same thing with EggX, will have to edit a second ts for EggX2,
   then change around the pxm in cave editor
- The game just uses too many colors
- The original game runs at 50 FPS. The physics have to be adjusted to 60
- I don't know what is going on with the Oside tileset and palette
- Drawing background crashes on hardware
- Drawing 3 bullets at a time or any damage numbers reduces framerate
- Player to entity collision slows down big maps a lot

FIXED
- The message window looks like shit
